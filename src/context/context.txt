Here, useContext hook is used which helps in sending states to the inner most componenets without hassel.

noteContext.js : It is made to make a context for notes, (nothing else)
noteState.js : It holds the state for the Notes and imports the context from noteContext.js

NOTE: 
    noteContext is imported in the components where you need the state for the notes
    noteState is imported in App.js to make available the state for the Notes to all the components
